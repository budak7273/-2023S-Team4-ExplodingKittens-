## Project Description
This project is an expansion and update for the 376 Project "Exploding Kittens." In this project, we have fixed
bugs in the original, cleaned up the GUI, and added substantial new features as well as made the code cleaner
and easier to understand. A list of new features is as follows:
- Added a message log to show players a message log of the most recent game events
- Created a message to notify players which card they have drawn from the stack
- Created a message to notify players which card has been stolen from them
- Created a notification system for Nope card usage
- Changed the original Nope timer system to a system in which players click to choose not to Nope
- Added feedback to notify players when a card is not allowed to be played
- Added card images to make the GUI more visually appealing
